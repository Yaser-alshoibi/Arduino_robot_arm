# Connecting Instructions
I designed a circuit with five servo motors and five potentiometer and Arduino, which can control all motors by each potentiometer to rotate between 5 and 85 degrees to avoid collision between the parts.

To connect all parts together first I took first two horizontal lines first line for positive 5 V from Arduino and second line is for ground. Then first servo motor will be connected with pin 3 for the signal and power and ground on the horizontal line connected in parallel. Then second servo will be connected with pin 5, third motor with pin 6, fourth motor with pin 9, fifth motor will be connected with pin 10.
After that, all five potentiometer will be connected in the same way as all servo motors in parallel, and first potentiometer signal line will be connected with analog pin A1, second potentiometer with A2, third and fourth and fifth potentiometers connected with pins A3, A4, A5 respectivly
